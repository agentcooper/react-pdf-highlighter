Introducing AnnoPDF
-------------------

AnnoPDF is an innovative tool tailored to optimize your engagement with PDF files. Whether you're navigating through dense research papers or casual reading, AnnoPDF serves as a dynamic platform to annotate, comment, and search within the document. You can access a PDF file either through an online link or by directly uploading it. A standout feature of AnnoPDF is its ability to preserve your annotations, ensuring that your insights and notes are right where you left them, making it an invaluable asset for academic pursuits.

The Inspiration Behind AnnoPDF
-------------------------------

AnnoPDF is a personal project I embarked on during the spring quarter of 2023 at Louisiana Tech University. The development journey spanned from March 17, 2023, to May 17, 2023. I have a deep-rooted interest in enhancing learning efficiency, and I envisioned a tool that could assist students in studying academic papers, which are predominantly in PDF format. I believed that a feature to leave comments directly on the PDF would facilitate their learning process, leading to the inception of AnnoPDF.

Key Features
------------

AnnoPDF is replete with features specifically crafted for students interacting with academic papers:

1. **External PDF Link Retrieval:** Fetch and display a PDF using an external link.
2. **Local File Loading:** Upload and view a PDF from your local file system.
3. **Annotating:** Create annotations directly on the PDF.
4. **Editing Annotations:** Edit your existing annotations.
5. **Deleting Annotations:** Remove any annotations that are no longer needed.
6. **Saving Annotations to Local Storage:** Preserve annotations in local storage for future access.
7. **Search Feature for Annotations:** Search for specific annotations within the document.

AnnoPDF is built upon the robust foundations of the `pdf.js <https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/>`_ and `react-pdf-highlighter.js <https://github.com/agentcooper/react-pdf-highlighter>`_ libraries, synergizing their capabilities to deliver an interactive PDF viewer and annotator.
