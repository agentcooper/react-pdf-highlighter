About AnnoPDF
=============

AnnoPDF is a personal project that I undertook during the spring quarter of 2023 at Louisiana Tech University. The development period spanned from March 17, 2023, to May 17, 2023. The project primarily leverages the `pdf.js <https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/>`_ and `react-pdf-highlighter.js <https://github.com/agentcooper/react-pdf-highlighter>`_ libraries to create an interactive PDF viewer and annotator.

Key Features
------------

AnnoPDF includes the following main features, designed with the needs of students studying academic papers in mind:

1. **External PDF Link Retrieval:** This feature allows the application to fetch and display a PDF using an external link.

2. **Local File Loading:** This feature enables users to upload and view a PDF from their local file system.

3. **Annotating:** This feature allows users to make annotations on the PDF.

4. **Editing Annotations:** With this feature, users can edit their existing annotations.

5. **Deleting Annotations:** This feature lets users remove any annotations they no longer need.

6. **Saving Annotations to Local Storage:** This feature allows the application to save annotations in the local storage for future access.

7. **Search Feature for Annotations:** This feature enables users to search through their annotations.
